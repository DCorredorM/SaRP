<H1><A NAME="SECTION00030000000000000000">Package Design</A></H1>
<P>
The package design is as follows. We have defined the following classes:
<PRE>
Action
State
Actions 
States
Policy 
Policies
DPSEnumeration 
MDP
DPProblem</PRE>
<P>
The last one is an abstract class, that contains the following abstract 
methods (functions):
<P>
<PRE>
double immediateReward(State p, Action q, int stage);
Actions getActions(State p, int stage)
States getStates(int stage)
State T(State p, Action q, stage t)</PRE>
<P>
Optionally, the user can override the following functions:
<P>
<b>States getStates(int stage)</b>: The set of possible states at this stage. By default returns a common set of states.
<P>
<b>double operation(double present, double future)</b> : the operator between present and future rewards. By default it's sum.
<P>
<b>double finalReward(State p)</b>. By default it is the optimal of immediate reward over all possible states.
<P>
If a user wants to solve a DP problem al she/he will have to do is to 
extend the class <b>DPProblem</b>, implementing the abstract funcions. It can be 
seen that there is a one to one correspondance between the theoretical 
and the computational framework, since all we want the user is to 
especify the forementioned elements of the DP Problem. This focus the 
user on the modelling, and leaves the computation to the internally 
defined functions.
<P>
Frequently the user might want to extend the classes Action and State, to define what the actions and states are. And also the class <b>States</b> and <b>Actions</b>, in order to define eficient numeration schemes.
<P>
Once the model is well defined, all the user will have 
to do is to call the method &quot;solve()&quot;. After the problem has been solved, the user can read the solution printing &quot;bestPolicy()&quot;, or with the variable &quot;policies&quot; 
obtained calling getPolicies().
<P>
In the stochastic case there are some slight modifications:
<UL><LI> The user should extend the class MDP instead of DPProblem.<LI> Instead of a transition function, the user must especify a transition probability function prob(p2,p1,q).<LI> The user can override the method <b>reachable(State p)</b> that gives the set of reachable states from a given state. This is particularlly useful when the probabilities matrx is a disperse matrix, because this will guarantee that the algorithm only checks some few states at every step, ignoring those for which the probability is 0.
</UL>
<P>
To fully understand each of this classes you should check the API (Aplication user Interface) at:

<P>
Also the next section gives some examples.
