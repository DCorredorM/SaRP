<P>
As a simple example on how the code can be used, we solve a cow herd 
problem stated as follows: A farmer has 50 cows at t=0, and must decide 
at the end of each year whether to keep them or to sell them. The 
forecasted selling prices for the nest five years are: 10,15,25,7,10.
<P>
To solve this problem we proceed as follows. For each of this items the 
user can see the equivalence in the code attached at the end of this 
section.
<OL><LI> Define States: We will define the state as the number of cows that 
the farmer currently has. If we look closely to the formulation we will 
notice that if selling one cows is advisable, then selling all of them is 
advisable as well. However for illustration purposes we will ignore that 
fact. We define the class <i>MyState</i> as an extension of the class 
State, whith one field called <i>caws</i>. Notice that the number of 
possible states goes from 50 up to 378 at the last stage (year 5). This 
fact is reflected in our code, through an implementation of getStates() 
that return only the possible states for the given stage.<LI> Actions. At any state two possible actions can be take: keep or 
sell. Actually we could have also differentiated different actions for 
the number of caws sold.<LI> The reward obtained is nothing if we don't sell and price*caws if 
we sell them.<LI> The transformation will be <I>T</I>(<I>p</I>,<I>q</I>,<I>k</I>)= 1.5<I>p</I> if we don't sell and 
<I>T</I>(<I>p</I>,<I>q</I>,<I>k</I>)=0 if we sell.
